# **CSS Zen Garden: Neon and Japanese Aesthetic Themes**

This project demonstrates the power and flexibility of CSS by applying two vastly different styles—**Neon** and **Japanese Aesthetic**—to the same HTML file. Both stylesheets showcase creative, professional, and production-ready designs that are toggled by switching stylesheets.

## **Project Overview**

The goal is to highlight how CSS can transform a single HTML file into two completely unique experiences:
- **Neon Theme (style.css):** A sleek, high-tech design with glowing neon effects, animated backgrounds, and vibrant color schemes.
- **Japanese Aesthetic Theme (style2.css):** A calming, nature-inspired design with soft colors, elegant typography, and subtle cultural motifs.

## **Features**

### **Neon Theme**
- Animated gradient background for a high-tech ambiance.
- Neon glow effects on text and buttons.
- Dynamic hover effects with smooth transitions and scaling.
- Responsive layout with flexbox and grid systems.

### **Japanese Aesthetic Theme**
- Subtle gradient and sakura-inspired background.
- Serif typography with traditional Japanese design aesthetics.
- Balanced use of whitespace for a clean, harmonious layout.
- Decorative borders and hover animations.
